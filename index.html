            </section>
            <section>
                <p>
                Chinese herbal therapy is a form of traditional Chinese medicine that uses natural herbs and other botanical ingredients to promote health and wellness. It has been used in China for thousands of years and is based on the belief that the body and mind are interconnected and that illness and disease result from imbalances in the body. <br>
                <br>

                Chinese herbal therapy’s long history dates back to the Shang dynasty (1600 BC – 1046 BC) in China. Over time, Chinese herbal therapy evolved, with new herbs being discovered and new techniques for preparing and administering herbs being developed. Today, Chinese herbal therapy is widely used in China and throughout the world as a natural alternative to modern medicine.

                <h2 style="color: #212741;">Yin-Yang Theory and Five Elements Theory in Chinese Herbal Therapy</h2>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>
                    Yin-Yang Theory and Five Elements Theory are two fundamental principles of Chinese herbal therapy. Yin-Yang Theory is based on the idea that all things in the universe are interconnected and exist in balance. According to Yin-Yang Theory, the body is composed of opposing but complementary forces, such as hot and cold, light and dark, and male and female. When these forces are in balance, the body is healthy, but illness and disease can occur when they are out of balance. <br>
                    <br>

                    The Five Elements Theory is based on the idea that the body is composed of five elements: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. Each element corresponds to a particular organ in the body, and each organ is connected to specific emotions and qualities. According to the Five Elements Theory, the body is healthy when the elements are in balance, but illness and disease can occur when they are out of balance.
